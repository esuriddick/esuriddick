- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m <b>esuriddick</b>. Despite of having a background in Economics and Finance, I have always been interested in programming and 3D computer graphics.
My goal is to learn and share my work as I go with others that may be interested and want to get inspired.


- :shopping_cart: Are you interested in seeing other projects of mine? Check out my 3D models in <a href="https://sketchfab.com/esuriddick">Sketchfab</a> and

- ðŸ“« Contacts: I am available for contact through private messaging in all of the platforms I mentioned. Feel free to send me a message!
